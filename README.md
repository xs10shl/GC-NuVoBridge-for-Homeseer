# GC-NuVoBridge-for-Homeseer

This series of Homeseer vb scripts which allows the three or four of you who may care to seemlessly interface 
a NuVo Grand Concerto or Grand Essentia to a number of popular music sources through Homeseer, including:
* up to 3 Sonos Connects (requires a Homeseer Sonos PI to function)
* up to 3 Chromecast Audio (Requires a Homeseer Chromecast PI to function)
* up to 3 Squeezebox servers *beta (Requires a Homeseer Squeezebox PI to function, tested only with a single Squeezebox player)
* a single NuVo Portfolio Source *alpha (I need a Portfolio Player to test this out)
* a single Heos Player, hosted on a Denon or Marantz receiver. This also facilitates AirPlay2 functionality

The system can work as a standalone interface between Homeseer and the GC, or in conjunction with either an MPS4 or an NV-MP/NV-NNA for deeper integration 
functionality. All configurations will provide full keypad control and metadata. 

GC NuVoBridge for Homeseer is also capable of providing enhanced NuVoNet services not before available using the NuVo GC platform, including:

* A simple Message-driven menu system of extended features for users who do not own an MPS4 or an MP-MV/MP-NNA
* NuVoNet-integrated and custom-taylored menu system for users with an MPS4 or NV-MP/NV-NNA
* Deep integration with Sonos S1 and S2, Sonos playlists, favorites, and more
* NuVo Macrobuilder, which allows users to create music “Playlists” of commands for NuVo and Homeseer to execute in sequence from any supported tablet/phone App.

Special thanks and credit to AVSforum.com user Bobone, who wrote the original vb scripts for CCA.  Some portions of his original code are 
still used in this release.

Background:
This project was started laregly to attempt to find a replacement for my then-lifeless MPS4, in order to prevent me needing to rip out my 15-zone GC setup, which I was rather fond of. Long story short: with the help of others, I've managed to resurreact and modernize my MPS4 to the point where much of this effort is redundant, but instead of trashing it, I decided to complete it to the point where I could feel happy about displaying it. I'll volunteer that I now know I should have just written a plugin for myself instead of relying on scripts.  Live and learn . . .
